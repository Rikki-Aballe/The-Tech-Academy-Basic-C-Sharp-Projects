# Twenty-One Game

The **Twenty-One Game** is a simple Blackjack game made with **C#**. Players try to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. It tracks the player's balance, has an admin mode to check errors, and logs any problems in a **SQL Server** database. The game keeps playing until the player runs out of money or decides to stop. It uses basic programming skills like handling errors, working with databases, and finding the best hand.
