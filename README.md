# Twenty-One Game

The **Twenty-One Game** is a simple Blackjack game made with **C#**. Players try to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. It tracks the player's balance, has an admin mode to check errors, and logs any problems in a **SQL Server** database. The game keeps playing until the player runs out of money or decides to stop. It uses basic programming skills like handling errors, working with databases, and finding the best hand.


# CarInsurance Project

The CarInsurance project is an ASP.NET MVC web application designed to calculate car insurance quotes based on user input, including factors like age, car make/model, speeding tickets, DUI history, and coverage type. The application uses **C#** for backend logic, **Entity Framework** for database interactions, and **SQL Server** to manage the data. The frontend is built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Bootstrap** for a responsive design, while **JavaScript** is used for form validation. Users can create, edit, view, and delete insurance records, and an admin view allows administrators to see all quotes. The project was developed using **Visual Studio** and **Git** for version control.


# Arrays and List
This C# program demonstrates basic operations with a `List<string>` and arrays. It shows how to add and remove items from a list, access elements by index, and print results to the console. The code also includes commented-out sections that illustrate how to initialize and modify arrays. The program prints `"Hello"` to the console after removing an item from the list. This example serves as a basic introduction to working with lists and arrays in C#.


# Iteration
This C# program goes through a list of test scores, checks if each score is greater than 85, and counts how many scores pass. It adds passing scores to a new list and then displays the total number of passing scores. This example demonstrates basic use of lists, loops, and conditionals in C#.
